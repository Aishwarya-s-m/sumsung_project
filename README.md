# sumsung_project
This project is an NLP-based automated document summarizer that extracts and condenses information from multiple file formats including PDF, Word, Excel, and Text. Instead of manually reading lengthy documents, the system leverages text extraction + natural language summarization techniques to generate concise, well-organized summaries.
